# DATAVIZ

Learning about Data Visualization while playing with [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

### Tools

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) React Framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) Utility-first CSS Framework
- [D3](https://d3js.org/) Data-Driven Documents

## Getting Started

Clone project, install dependencies, and run the development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/colormono/dataviz.git && cd dataviz
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
